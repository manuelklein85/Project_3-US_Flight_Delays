# Project 3: US Flight Delays (Capstone Project)
This is the final project created during the Data Science Bootcamp of neuefische Gmbh, Hamburg, Germany. The project is about flight delays in the US. All domestic flights between 2016 and 2018 in the US have been analyzed in order to identify the main influencing factors for these delays. Moreover, a predictive model has been set up, giving the opportunity to estimate the amount of delay of any future flight in the US.<br><br>

<b>The following business cases are addressed:</b><br><br>

* Airlines need to have a deep understanding of delays for scheduling flights, planning reserve planes at specific airports etc. This includes reasons for delays as well as expected delay times.
* Airlines want to reduce their delays. Thus they need to understand what are the main influencing factors for delays and which of them can be tackled
* Airlines want to understand if the perform better or worse in comparison to their competitors regarding delay at e.g. a specific flight route
* Passengers want to know how likely a certain delay for a specific booking is (e.g. departure and landing airports, date, day of the week, time etc.) and how high that delay might be
